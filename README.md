# scalable-qa-with-docker

Are you tired of maintaining all your Jenkins jobs running Selenium WebDriver tests connecting to several Jenkins slaves and the inconsistency of the setup? 
We need to become aware that it's inefficient to keep all the environments, browsers and selenium web drivers up to date manually. 

During this session the attendees will be introduced to setting up scalable and solid Selenium Grids. 
Weâ€™ll also teach you how to write maintainable and scalable Selenium / WebDriver tests.

Trough practical examples and exercises the following questions will be answered:

* What makes a good Selenium Grid?
* Do we need to support all browsers?
* What is a good strategy to setup Selenium Grids with multiple teams?
* How to use the Selenium Grid locally?
* How to build and scale the Selenium Grid(s) using Docker?
* How do you write a solid Selenium / WebDriver test using the Selenium Grid?
